DATA DICTIONARY - UCI HAR Dataset Analysis 

Starting Data Set Description:

The starting dataset comes from the UCI Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Description of the Dataset xAgg (transformations on original UCI HAR Dataset):

Combine the Test and Train datasets into one large dataset of all observations.
Extracted only the mean() and std() calculations for each of the measurement variables (listed above).
Attached a column of data to identify the Subject for which the data for each variable is captured.
Attached a column of data to identify the Activity that the Subject is performing in each variable measurement.
Labeled all variables with descriptive variable names.
Reshaped dataset to calculate the average of each variable for each Subject (1 through 30) and each Activity (Laying, Sitting, Standing, Walking, WalkingDownstairs, WalkingUpstairs). 

Variables in Dataset xAgg:

Subject		
	Volunteer performing activity, uniquely numbered 1 through 30.

Activity
	Type of activity performed to gain each piece of data - 6 different activities in total for each Subject.
		Laying
		Sitting
		Standing
		Walking 
		WalkingDownstairs
		WalkingUpstairs
